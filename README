Hulk
====

It's like juggernaut (https://github.com/maccman/juggernaut), but better, because it doesn't use that janky-ass socket.io.

It uses EventSource, puts in a polyfill for those poor IE users, and will be mostly API-compatible with Juggernaut. Ideally it'll be a dropin replacement - just do something like this:

    Juggernaut = Hulk;

    var h = new Hulk;
    h.subscribe("channel1", function(data){
      console.log(data);
    });

You can use the same Juggernaut gem you've been using in the past, just swap out the node server.
